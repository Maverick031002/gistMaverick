# Exercises:

# • Modify the machine to always halt on the leftmost digit
#   (regardless of the number's length).
#   Hint: add a state between carry and done.

# • Make a machine that adds 2 instead of 1.
#   Hint: 2 is '10' in binary, so the last digit is unaffected.
#   Alternative hint: chain together two copies of the machine from
#   the first exercise (renaming the states of the second copy).

# • Make a machine to subtract 1.
#   To simplify things, assume the input is always greater than 0.
